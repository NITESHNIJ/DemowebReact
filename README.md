## Tech Stack

React.js is the library used to make the front end of the project.

The project uses core concepts of React as: Redux and Thunk, alongside using FLUX Architecture.

There is no database involved. All the data used is available locally.
The changes and addition of data done by the user is also done locally, and the changes are stored locally using redux store.

All the data have been centrally stored in Redux stores and all the changes to the store is made by react actions.

The concept and workflow of Thunk have been used to make intermediate actions.
